**Project is not yet finished.**

The project is being made with the SpringBoot framework as the backend, I used https://start.spring.io
for the initilazir and included:
- Spring Boot DevTools
- Lombook
- MySQL Driver
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Web

I used https://web.postman.co to test the REST API tests, so I know they work.
Currently I have only implemented the POST and GET methods.

The frontend design is being made in Angular while using Bootstrap 5.1 css framework. 
The design is not complete yet, I wish to add some of my own personal styling.

The data is stored in MySQL, if you have MySQL workbench you can view the database that gets autocreated. 
Please set your root username and password in the application file, it is located in the back-end folder
src/main/resources.
